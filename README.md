This is originally code made in Google's Colaboratory,
It make predictions on video game success through Youtube and Metacritic engagement.
To run, you must have atleast matplotlib 3.4 and the csv file to input when prompted (it will show a button asking for the file).
Each run provides a sample of what the table looks like, gives confusion matrixes, reports, and charts.
The Accuracy and F1 results can change per run by ~ 20%. This is due to the training process with a small dataset.
